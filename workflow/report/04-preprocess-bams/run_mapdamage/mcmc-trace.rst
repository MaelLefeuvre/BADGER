- *Theta*: average rate of divergence between the sequence data and the reference genome that is not explained by PMD.
- *Rho*: Damage rate
- *DeltaD*: cytosine deamination probability within a *double-strand* context
- *DeltaS*: cytosine deamination probability within a *single-strand* context
- *Lambda*: overhang termination probability
- *LogLik*: LogLikelihood
